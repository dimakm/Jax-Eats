## Overview

This is a single page application showing a map of some restaurants in St.Johns Town Center in Jacksonville, FL . 
The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map.
It was Made as the final project of Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.
 
This application follows this [Udacity Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1351/view)

## Important

The project was created with create-react-app and I used the created service worker for it, so if you want to use the **Service Worker** create-react-app in your computer and put my files in it.
The **Service Worker** works in the **production build**.
